      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p> The Strokes are a rock band from New York that got really popular in the early 2000s. They started in 1998 and hit it big with their first album, *Is This It*, in 2001. The music had a simple, rough sound that people loved, with catchy guitar parts and laid-back singing from their lead singer, Julian Casablancas. Songs like "Last Nite" and "Someday" became super popular.

Even though they've tried new things with their music over the years, they still keep that cool, classic vibe that made them famous, and they’re still a big name in indie rock..</p>
